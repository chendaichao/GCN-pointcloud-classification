# Pointcloud Classification with PointNet and GCNs

This is a project using PointNet and GCNs for pointcloud classification. We implement the original PointNet<sup>[1]</sup> and its variant which incorporates graph convolutional networks<sup>[2]</sup> as well. Both models are trained and tested on ModelNet40<sup>[3]</sup> Datasets.
