# Pointcloud Classification with PointNet and GCNs

This is a project of using PointNet and GCNs for pointcloud classification. We implement the original PointNet[^1] and its variant which incorporates graph convolutional networks[^2] as well. Both models are trained and tested on ModelNet40[^3] Datasets.
